## ╭─────────────────────────────╮
## │   100% Vibe Coded  ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ │
## ╰─────────────────────────────╯

This entire project was **vibe coded** — designed, built, and shipped using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding agent). Every line of Swift, every SwiftUI view, every audio engine architecture decision, every CI pipeline — all of it.

**What does that mean?**
- A human ([@ddmoney420](https://github.com/ddmoney420)) directed the vision, made decisions, and tested on real devices
- An AI (Claude) wrote the code, debugged the issues, and iterated on the architecture
- The result is a real, functional, App Store-ready music player

We're not hiding it — we're proud of it. This is what vibe coding looks like when you push it to its limits. ✧･ﾟ:*✧･ﾟ:*

**Want to contribute?** We'd love that. This project is open for development — whether you're a human, an AI, or somewhere in between. See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

- **Cache management** — configurable size limits with LRU eviction (pinned playlists protected)
- **Offline star/scrobble queue** — actions sync automatically on reconnect

### Platform ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ
- **CarPlay support** — browse, search, artist radio, and playback controls
- **macOS native app** — NavigationSplitView sidebar, keyboard shortcuts, pop-out player
- **Internet radio** — streaming radio stations with HTTP media support

## Requirements

- Xcode 16+ (Swift 6.0)
- iOS 17.0+ / macOS 14.0+
- A Navidrome server (or any Subsonic API-compatible server)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Swift 6 (strict concurrency) |
| UI | SwiftUI |
| Persistence | SwiftData |
| Audio | AVQueuePlayer (gapless), AVPlayer (crossfade), AVAudioEngine (EQ) |
| CarPlay | CPTemplate |
| Build System | XcodeGen |
| Image Loading | NukeUI (with disk caching) |
| Credentials | KeychainAccess |

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Prerequisites: Xcode 16+, XcodeGen (brew install xcodegen)

# Generate Xcode project
make generate

# Build
make build-ios     # iOS Simulator
make build-macos   # macOS native

# Test
make test

# Lint
make lint
```

## Architecture

```
App/                 App entry, AppState singleton, Theme
CarPlay/             CarPlay scene delegate and template manager
Core/
  Audio/             AudioEngine (3 backends), EQEngine, CrossfadeController,
                     SleepTimer, NowPlayingManager, RemoteCommandManager
  Downloads/         Background URLSession download manager, CacheManager
  Networking/        SubsonicClient, auth, models, endpoints, OfflineActionQueue
  Persistence/       SwiftData models (DownloadedSong, OfflinePlaylist, PendingAction, etc.)
Features/            SwiftUI views organized by feature
  Library/           Artist, album, song, genre, and folder browsing
  Player/            Now playing, mini player, lyrics, visualizer
  Playlists/         Playlist management and smart playlists
  Radio/             Internet radio stations
  Search/            Global search
  Settings/          Server config, appearance, playback, EQ settings
  Visualizer/        Metal shader-based audio visualizer
  Downloads/         Download management UI
Shared/              Reusable components (TrackRow, AlbumCard, StarButton) and extensions
```

### Playback Architecture

Three mutually exclusive playback topologies, selected by mode priority:

```
Mode Priority (highest wins):
1. EQ Mode    — eqEnabled + downloaded  →  AVAudioEngine + EQ + TimePitch
2. Crossfade  — crossfadeDuration > 0   →  Dual AVPlayer with volume ramps
3. Gapless    — crossfadeDuration == 0  →  AVQueuePlayer with lookahead
```

`AudioEngine.shared` is the single facade. All UI, CarPlay, and remote commands talk only to AudioEngine — never to backends directly.
